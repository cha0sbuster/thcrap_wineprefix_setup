# thcrap_wineprefix_setup

It sets up a working wineprefix for playing Touhou games with thprac. There's not a whole lot to it. If you want actual documentation it's in the script itself.

## features

- draws the owl
- ensures a 32-bit wineprefix
- avoids you nuking your existing wineprefix if you already had one
- is overbuilt to shit but that's what you get when you have crippling autism and you get nerdsniped into solving a problem that 100% was not your job

## requirements

- wine (tested on 9.0)
- winetricks
- uh thats it

## usage

- [save it](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cha0sbuster/thcrap_wineprefix_setup/refs/heads/main/thcrap_wineprefix_setup.sh)
- run it
- bop it
- twist it
- pull it
